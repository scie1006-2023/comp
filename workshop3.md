## Part 2: Python Conditions and If Statements

If Statement is applied during the decision-making process.  It has a body of code that only executes when the if statement's condition is met. The optional else statement, which includes some code for the else condition, runs if the condition is false.

1. Try the following code in **`conditions.py`**.

   ```python
   a = 20
   b = 30

   if b > a:
       print(f'{b} is greater than {a}')
   ```

   In this case, the condition being checked is `b > a`, which checks if the value of `b` is greater than the value of `a`.

   Here are some commonly used conditions and logical operators in python:

   ```python
   if a < b:
      print(f'{a} is less than {b}')

   if a >= b:
      print(f'{a} is greater than or equal to {b}')

   if a <= b:
      print(f'{a} is less than or equal to {b}')

   if a == b:
      print(f'{a} is equal to {b}')

   if a != b:
      print(f'{a} is not equal to {b}')
   ```
2. The `else` statement is used in conjunction with an if statement to specify a block of code that should be executed when the condition of the if statement evaluates to False.

   ```python
   a = 20
   b = 30

   if a > b:
       print(f'{a} is greater than {b}')
   else:
       print(f'{a} is less than or equal to {b}')

   ```

## Part 3: Output Sensor Data with Speech

1. Get back the **`sensor.py`** you have completed in the previous session and save it to the MyProject folder.

   ```python
   from smbus2 import SMBus
   import time
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   import datetime

   # Your URI copied from MongoDB Atlas website
   # Replace <password> with the password you created for your database user
   uri = 'mongodb+srv://db:<password>@cluster0...:27017/'
   client = MongoClient(uri)
   db = client.database

   bus = SMBus(7)

   # The code block inside while True loop repeats continuously until 
   # you press Ctrl+C in the terminal
   while True:
      # trigger the sensor to do measurement
      bus.write_i2c_block_data(0x38, 0xAC, [0x33, 0x00]) 
      # wait for 0.5 seconds
      time.sleep(0.5)
      # read data from the sensor
      data = bus.read_i2c_block_data(0x38, 0x00, 8)

      temp = ((data[3] & 0x0F) << 16) | (data[4] << 8) | data[5]
      humi = ((data[1] << 16) | (data[2] << 8) | data[3]) >> 4

      temperature = temp / (2**20) * 200 - 50
      print(u'Temperature: {0:.1f}°C'.format(temperature))

      humidity = humi / (2**20) * 100
      print(u'Humidity: {0:.1f}%'.format(humidity))       

      record = {
         "sensor_id": 1,
         "temp": temperature,
         "humi": humidity,
         "date": datetime.datetime.now(),
      }

      db.sensors.insert_one(record)

      # wait for 60 seconds
      time.sleep(60) 
   ```
2. To play speech output, we need to import the `pyttsx3` library. Let's import the library at the top of the program.

   ```python
   import pyttsx3
   ```
3. Then, use the following program code to produce speech. Please add the following code **before** the `while` loop.

   ```python
   engine = pyttsx3.init()
   engine.say("Program started")
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
4. To output the temperature value with speech, add the following code to the program right **after the print statement of the temperature value**, which is `print(u'Temperature: {0:.1f}°C'.format(temperature))`.

   ```python
   engine = pyttsx3.init()
   engine.say(u'Temperature is now {0:.1f}°'.format(temperature))
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```
5. **Exercise: Output humidity value with speech**

   Write code in the program to speak the humidity value out loud. It should say "Humidity is now XX%". You should put the code right **after the print statement of the humidity value**, which is `print(u'Humidity: {0:.1f}%'.format(humidity)) `.

   ```python
   # Exercise: Output humidity value with speech
   # Fill out the ... below
   engine = pyttsx3.init()
   engine.say(....)
   engine.runAndWait()
   ```


## Part 4: LED Alert System

In this section, we will learn how to make an LED alert system with Python. We will use the `python-periphery` library to control the LED connected to the ROCK Pi with GPIO.

### General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)

General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins are pins that can be used for input or output. They are usually used to connect to external devices such as sensors and actuators.

The LED is connected to the GPIO pin `146` for the Red channel and `150` for the Green channel.

1. Let's import the GPIO from the periphery library at the top of the program.

   ```python
   from periphery import GPIO
   ```
2. Add the following code to the program right **before** the `while` loop. It will turn on the Red LED for 3 seconds and then turn it off.

   ```python
   # set GPIO pin 146 as an output pin
   red_led = GPIO(146, "out")
   # turn on the red LED
   red_led.write(True)
   # wait for 3 seconds
   time.sleep(3)
   # turn off the red LED
   red_led.write(False)
   ```
3. **Exercise: Turning on and off the Green LED**

   Write code in the program to turn on the Green LED for 3 seconds and then turn it off **before** the `while` loop.

   ```python
   # Exercise: Turning on and off the Green LED
   # Fill out the ... below
   
   # set GPIO pin 150 as an output pin
   green_led = GPIO(..., "out")
   # turn on the green LED
   green_led.write(...)
   # wait for 3 seconds
   time.sleep(...)
   # turn off the green LED
   green_led.write(...)
   ```

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
5. Now, we have learned how to turn on and off the LEDs. Let's detect whether the temperature is too high in the program. Add the following code to the program right **before** the `time.sleep(60)` statement in the `while` loop. Mind the spacing.

   ```python
   if temperature > 28:
       print("Temperature is too high")
       # turn on the red LED
       red_led.write(True)
   else:
       print("Temperature is normal")
       # turn off the red LED
       red_led.write(False)
   ```

   When the temperature is too high, this code turns on the red LED, and when the temperature is normal, it turns the LED off.
